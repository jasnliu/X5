# Strike lab results

Unloaded lower-zone timing only; simulation is not physical evidence or sound quality.

Statistics include every measured attempt, even failed strokes; missing measurements are not zeros.
Only all-pass groups can enter comparisons. See JSON for measurement counts and failure reasons.
